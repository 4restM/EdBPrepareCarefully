This directory should contain the DLL dependencies required to build the mod.
                                                                            
The solution has dependencies on the following two DLLs:
- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- UnityEngine.dll

Copy those dependencies from the RimWorld game directory into the "Libraries" directory.  Be sure to make _copies_ of the originals--don't accidentally move/delete them from the original game directory.
